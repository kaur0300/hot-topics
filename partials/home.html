    <p>In the United States, the U.S. dollar determines the value of money. There are three ways to measure the value of the dollar. The first is how much the dollar will buy in foreign currencies. The exchange rate measures that value. Forex traders on the foreign exchange market determine that value. They take into account current supply and demand, as well as their expectations for the future. For this reason, the value of money fluctuates throughout the trading day.The second method is the value of Treasury notes. They can be converted easily into dollars through the secondary market for Treasuries. When the demand for Treasuries is high, the value of all money in America rises. The third way the dollar's value is measured is by foreign exchange reserves. That is the amount of dollars held by foreign governments. The more they hold, the lower the supply. That makes U.S. money more valuable. If foreign governments were to sell their dollar and Treasury holdings, the dollar would collapse. Then U.S. money would be worth a lot less. No matter how it's measured, the dollar's value declined from 2000 to 2011 thanks to a relatively low Fed funds rate, a high Federal debt, and a slow-growth economy. Since 2011, the U.S. dollar has risen in value despite these factors. Why? Most of the economies in the world are slowing down, which makes traders want to invest in the dollar as a safe haven. For more, see Euro to Dollar Conversion. You notice the value of money most directly at the gas pump and the grocery store. That's because the prices of gas and food are inelastic. Producers know you have to buy gas and food every week. You can't easily delay purchases when the price rises. They will pass on any of their extra costs. You buy it at that price for a while before reducing your demand for that item. When the price of gas or food goes up, you are experiencing the reduced value of money.

    <p>The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies.
